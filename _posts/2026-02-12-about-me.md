Sophomore-hood is oxymoronic: sophomore is composed of the Ancient Greek σοφός (sophos, wise) and μωρός (moros, fool). Wise fool is certainly how I navigate the world.

I hope to err more on the wise side for my Classics and Comparative Literature majors. My focus is Ancient Greek language and music culture. I love learning languages, so I hope I can learn my first programming one in eTextiles!

My sewing experience is not extensive, but I've mended and done mini sewing projects. My programming experience is limited to some coding in elementary school on Code.org.

Perhaps boringly, I can't stand Micheal Bublé.
