Sabrina's my name, and computers aren't my game! Yet, now you're caught in my web-site. I love anything meta (metafiction, metaphor, metalinguistics),  which is Greek for 'beyond,' and this is my crack at making an online metasabrina. Even more, I'm in a class where we combine electronics and textiles to expand the possibilities in those directions!
