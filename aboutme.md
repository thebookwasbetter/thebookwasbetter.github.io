Sabrina's my name, and computers aren't my game! 

Yet, now you're caught in my web(site). I love anything meta (metafiction, metaphor, metalinguistics), which is Greek for 'beyond.' This is my crack at making an online metasabrina. In this class where electronics + textiles = eTextiles, I'm ready to make waves in the material world with the clacking of my keyboard!
