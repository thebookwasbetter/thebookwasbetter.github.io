Sabrina's my name, and computers aren't my game! 

Yet, somehow you're caught in the web(site) I've spun. Even spinning this simple web has scratched the itch that made me join an Electronic Textiles class: to create something interactive! My most recent project involved building a fully-functioning Ancient Greek lyre instrument replica. One of the most exciting parts was curating a [blog post](https://sites.williams.edu/makerspace/projects/) about my process! 

This made me realize the joy of generating and sharing a physical project, where you gain new hands-on and electronic skills. Every time I create something, I realize my own limitations and how much I rely on the expertise of others. Coding is very off the beaten path for me, so everything I learn is a new way of understanding how we circulate our creativity!
